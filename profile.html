        	sooo i am pursuing engg from shadan clg of engg and tech (peerancheru), and its far from my home 
        	so i never go alone not because iam scared but because i get bored easily,
        	so by the way i have bunch of backlogs which i can't forget , iam trying to clear them but its being very hard now.<br><br>
        	<h3>Now</h3>
        	I want to focus on some productive things in my life so iam trying to enter web development industry
        	iam trying not to make it like my engg and i think it should be fun but its irritating at first because there are so many problems while designing a single web page i hope i get better at it.
